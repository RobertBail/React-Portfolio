        <p>
        I'm Robert Bailey. I'm 35. I live in Hampstead Gardens, SA. I have taken part in the edX/University of Adelaide 
        coding bootcamp to develop some more skills and knowledge specifically in web development. 
        I have found it an interesting mix of technical and creative.
